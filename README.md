- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rebrambora
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, Arduino and electrotechnics in general. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ricing, bash scripts and similar stuff. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on probably whatever you want- well if you ever needed an really interested noob for something, here I am, otherwise I wouldn't probably be the best person to collaborate with...for now... I'm willing to learn in the future.
